Step 5: Zenmap
Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine:
Run the RDP to start the Pentesting Lab.
Open the Hyper-V-Manager to view all the active VM's.
Double click the Kali VM to start.
Start the Terminal
From the Terminal enter the command zenmap
The Metasploitable machine IP address is 192.168.0.10
Input Target 192.168.0.10
Profile: Quick scan
The raw nmap Command is nmap -T4 -A 192.168.0.10
Click the SCAN button to get the results.
ZENMAP

Bonus command to output results into a new text file named zenmapscan.txt:
To save the results in the zenmapscan.txt add the following on the command line: -oN zenmapscan.txt so it should look as following: nmap -T4 -A -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10
You can also enter this in the Terminal command line: nmap -T4 -A -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10
zenmapscan.txt

zenmapscan.txt - file

Zenmap vulnerability script command:

There are two scrips that can be located in Zenmap for vulnerability associated with the service running on the 139/445 port.
From the Profile tab select Edit Selected Profile
Select the Scripting tab and view all the scripts.
Check the box off for the ftp-vsftpd-backdoor and smb-enum-shares.
Save Changes to save the profile settings.
The raw command should look like:
nmap -T4 -F --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10

-T4: -T<0-5>: Set timing template (higher is faster)
-F: Fast mode - Scan fewer ports than the default scan
--script: Runs the scripted scan that is followed.
ftp-vsftpd-backdoor: This script attempts to exploit the backdoor using the innocuous id command by default, but that can be changed with the exploit.cmd or ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.cmd ...
smb-enum-shares: Host script results: | smb-enum-shares: | account_used: WORKGROUP\â€‹Administrator | ADMIN$ | Type: STYPE_DISKTREE_HIDDEN | Comment: Remote Admin ...
192.168.0.10: IP address of host that will be scanned.
Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:

What is the vulnerability:

As per the below snapshots Zenmap was able to enumerate the vulnerable service for port 139/445.
Zenmap scan against the Metasploitable machine vulnerability scan results
Zenmap scan against the Metasploitable machine vulnerability scan results
Why is it dangerous:

This is dangerous due to the VSFTPD 2.3.4 backdoor attack can be applied on port 21 via a malicious code, if successful execution, opens the backdoor on port 6200.

This backdoor was introduced into the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive between June 30th 2011 and July 1st 2011 according to the most recent information available. This backdoor was removed on July 3rd 2011. (1)
The concept of the attack on VSFTPD 2.3.4 is to trigger the malicious vsf_sysutil_extra(); function by sending a sequence of specific bytes on port 21, which, on successful execution, results in opening the backdoor on port 6200 of the system and running as root. (2)
The Windows Server Message Block (SMB) get access through the organization's networks, the SMB protocols used by PC's for file and printer sharing, along with the remote access services.

SMB vulnerabilities allow their payloads to spread laterally through connected systems. (3)
What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:

The vsFPTD 2.3.4 patch was released on July 3, 2011 with the patch constantly monitered and updated.

The vsFTPD v2.3.4 backdoor reported on 2011-07-04 (CVE-2011-2523). (4)
The SMB (CVE-2017-0145) patch was released by Microsoft MS17-010 , and the SAMBA (CVE-2017-0145) patches were released by Red Had for Linux RHSA-2017:1390 (5, 6 & 7)
